This project originated as an exercise in using React and APIs. 
The task involved creating the Netflix webpage and displaying the catalog of available movies from the API. The movies are organized by sagas, but can also be searched through a search bar. For each movie, users can view reviews written by other users and have the ability to add and modify their own reviews.

Questo progetto nasce come esercitazione nell'utilizzo di React e delle API. 
L'esercizio consisteva nel creare la pagina web di Netflix e visualizzare il catalogo film disponibile nell'API. I film sono raccolti per saghe, ma possono anche essere ricercati tramite una barra di ricerca. Per ogni film, è possibile visualizzare le recensioni scritte dagli utenti e si ha la possibilità di aggiungere e modificare le proprie recensioni.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
